#This code is a basic burger bot where it takes your order and shows certain statistics.
'''
1. Manager: This feature enables the manager to enter the manager code and enter the quantity of burgers needed.
2. Display: This presents all of the available order options including standard or custom
3. Order: The customers place orders for burgers.
4. Report: Provides the statistics for the bot machine.
